# spicepy v3.0.0 (Jan 27, 2025)

The v3.0.0 release upgrades the `spicepy` SDK to align with the standard feature set provided by Spice.ai OSS v1.0 runtime (`spiced`), removing deprecated functions and adding support for dataset refresh.

## Highlights in v3.0.0

- **Dataset Refresh:** Accelerated datasets can be refreshed by the `Client.refresh_dataset(dataset_name, refresh_options)` method.

Example code:

```python
client.refresh_dataset(
    "taxi_trips",
    RefreshOpts(refresh_sql="SELECT * FROM taxi_trips LIMIT 10"),
)
```

- **Customizable User Agent:** A user agent string can now be provided to the `Client` when creating a new instance. This user agent is supplied on every HTTP and Flight request.

Example code:

```python
client = Client(api_key, flight_url, http_url, tls_root_cert, user_agent)
```

If a user agent is not specified, a default user agent is provided as `spicepy 3.0.0 (<OS type>/<OS version> <OS arch>)`. E.g.: `spicepy 3.0.0 (Linux/5.4.0-1043-aws x86_64)`

## Breaking Changes

- **Fire Query Removed:** All SDK functionality relating to Fire Query has been removed, as Spice.ai OSS 1.0 queries have fire cache functionality by default.
